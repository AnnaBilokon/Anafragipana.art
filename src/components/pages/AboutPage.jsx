            Hi! My name is Anastasiia Aliapkina. I am a Graphic Designer based
            in Stockholm, Sweden.
            <br />
            In my previous career, I held the position of a professional dancer,
            utilizing the art of body movement as my primary mode of
            self-expression. Subsequently, I had the privilege of delving into
            the realm of children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder, where
            I devoted over two years of my professional life as a valuable
            resource for a child with autism. This transformative experience
            broadened my horizons and significantly reshaped my perspective on
            the world around me.
            <br />
            Today, I am driven by a profound desire to communicate my thoughts
            and ideas through visual language. As a result, I aspire to
            establish myself as a graphic designer, a field that embodies the
            principles of exploration, revelation, and artistic self-expression.
            Graphic design, to me, represents an ongoing voyage of learningâ€”a
            pursuit that I wholeheartedly embrace.
            <br />
            My passion for design ignites a profound sense of joy within me as I
            navigate every facet of the creative process, commencing with
            meticulous research and culminating in the delivery of a polished
            final product.
